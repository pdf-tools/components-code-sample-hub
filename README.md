# PDF Tools Sample Code Repository

This repository contains sample projects for the **Pdftools SDK** and the **Toolbox add-on**, providing implementations for various use cases across multiple programming languages.

---

## Organization of Samples

Each use case has its own folder. Within each folder:
* A general README.md provides instructions on how to execute the sample in each supported programming language.
* The folder may also contain test files that can be used to test the sample.
