# PDF Tools Sample Code Repository

This repository contains sample codes for the **PDF Tools SDK** and the **Toolbox Addon**, providing implementations for various use cases across multiple programming languages. It is designed to help developers integrate PDF functionalities into their applications with ease.

---

## Sample Organization

Each sample (or use case) is organized into a dedicated folder. Within each folder:
* A general README.md provides instructions on how to execute the sample in all supported programming languages.
* The folder may also contain test files that can be used to run and validate the sample.

## Repository Structure

The repository follows this structure:

```
