# Pdftools Sample Code Repository

This repository contains sample projects demonstrating the **Pdftools SDK** and the **Toolbox add-on**. It offers implementations for various use cases across multiple programming languages and is designed to assist developers in seamlessly integrating PDF functionalities into their applications.

## Organization of samples

Each use case is contained in its own folder. Within each folder, you can find the following:
* A general `README.md` with instructions on how to execute the sample in each supported programming language.
* You may find test files that you can use to test the sample.
